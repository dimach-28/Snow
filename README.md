It was kind of boring so I decided to write a simple sketch of snow (snowflakes).

The library is loved by all and very powerful  U8g2.

What we need: Arduino Uno board display i2c and the wires themselves.

We connect everything according to the diagram:
SCK-A4
SDA-A5
VSS-5V
GND-GND
Let's go to Arduino ide copy the code, paste it, download it and everything works.
